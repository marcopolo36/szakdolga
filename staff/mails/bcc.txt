$to = 'to@example.com';
$cc = 'cc@example.com';
$recipients = $to.", ".$cc;
$headers['From']    = 'from@example.com';
$headers['To']      = $to;
$headers['Subject'] = 'Test message';
$headers['Cc']      = 'cc@example.com';
$headers['Reply-To'] = 'from@example.com';
 
$send = $mail->send($recipients, $headers, $body);
The solution works perfectly. 
Now the email addresses show up in the correct fields and all the recipients receive the email.
To Blind CC (aka, BCC) an address, simply add the address to the $recipients, 
but not to any of the $headers (thanks Jason!).
